# Decentralized Barter Market

This repository hosts the code for building a decentralized barter market on the Ethereum blockchain. The implementation leverages the power of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) as the development environment and utilizes [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) for interaction with simulated nodes. 

The code has been successfully compiled and tested under Ubuntu 18.04.
